## 2. Complete User Flow — Step-by-Step Checklist

### PHASE 1: Login (OTP)
- [ ] App opens → LoginScreen shown
- [ ] User enters 10-digit mobile number
- [ ] "Send OTP" calls `POST /api/auth/send-otp` → QA backend (`services.qa.i2e1.in`)
- [ ] OTP received, user enters 4-digit OTP
- [ ] "Verify" calls `GET /api/auth/verify-otp?mobile=...&otp=...`
- [ ] On success: JWT token stored in DataStore, `isLoggedIn = true`
- [ ] NavGraph transitions to: check `isProfileComplete`

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Invalid phone number (less than 10 digits) → validation error
- [ ] Wrong OTP → error message, user can retry
- [ ] OTP expired → user must request new OTP
- [ ] Network failure during OTP send → error toast
- [ ] Network failure during OTP verify → error toast
- [ ] Token already exists (re-login) → should overwrite old token
- [ ] Backend returns non-200 → proper error message shown

### PHASE 2: Onboarding (Registration Form)
- [ ] If `isProfileComplete = false` → OnboardingScreen shown
- [ ] Multi-step form collects:
  - Business Name, Entity Type
  - State, City, Area, Pincode
  - GPS Location (latitude, longitude, address via device GPS)
  - PAN Number, Aadhaar Number
  - Bank Account Name, Account Number, IFSC, Bank Name
- [ ] "Submit" calls `POST /v1/partner/register` with Bearer token
- [ ] On success: `isProfileComplete = true` in DataStore
- [ ] NavGraph transitions to PendingScreen

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] All fields required → validation before submit
- [ ] GPS location required → user must tap "Get Current Location" before submit
- [ ] Location permission denied → shows message to enable in Settings
- [ ] GPS timeout or unavailable → user cannot proceed without location
- [ ] Address auto-filled from reverse geocoding but editable
- [ ] PAN format validation (ABCDE1234F)
- [ ] Aadhaar format validation (12 digits)
- [ ] IFSC format validation (e.g., SBIN0001234)
- [ ] Duplicate registration (same mobile) → backend returns error
- [ ] Session expired (401) → should redirect to login
- [ ] Network error during submit → error toast, form data preserved
- [ ] User kills app mid-submission → form state not persisted (user must re-enter)
- [ ] Backend 500 → "Something went wrong" message

### PHASE 3: Registration Fee Payment (₹2,000)
- [ ] PendingScreen shows → fetches `GET /v1/partner/status` (polls every 5s)
- [ ] Status = `PENDING` + `feePaid = false` → PaymentScreen shown
- [ ] Shows registration fee amount: ₹2,000
- [ ] "Pay Now" button calls `POST /v1/payment/initiate` with `registrationId`
- [ ] Backend creates PaymentTransaction (paymentType = `REGISTRATION_FEE`)
- [ ] Backend returns `paymentLink` from Juspay
- [ ] App opens Chrome Custom Tab with payment link
- [ ] App polls `GET /v1/payment/status/:transactionId` every 5s (max 60 attempts = 5 min)
- [ ] On payment success → `feePaid = true` in DB → status transitions to `PENDING`
- [ ] Screen updates to show "Under Review" state

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Payment link already exists (user re-opens app) → reuse existing link, resume polling
- [ ] User closes Chrome tab without paying → polling continues, shows "Verifying" state
- [ ] Payment times out (5 min) → shows "Payment verification timed out" message with retry
- [ ] User pays but polling hasn't caught it yet → next status poll will detect `feePaid = true`
- [ ] Juspay returns failure → `FAILED` status, user can retry
- [ ] Double payment attempt → backend returns existing pending transaction
- [ ] Network loss during payment → Chrome tab may still complete; polling catches it on reconnect
- [ ] App killed during payment → on reopen, `fetchStatus` picks up existing paymentInfo and resumes polling
- [ ] Chrome Custom Tab not available → fallback to regular browser intent

### PHASE 4: Admin Review
- [ ] Admin opens `http://satyam.wiom.in/csp/admin` → sees registration in list
- [ ] Registration shows status badge (PENDING with green "fee paid" indicator)
- [ ] Admin can view all submitted details (business info, bank details, GPS location with Google Maps link, documents)
- [ ] Admin has 3 actions:
  - **Approve** → status = `APPROVED`
  - **Reject** (with reason) → status = `REJECTED`
  - **Request Info** (with message + requested doc types) → status = `INFO_REQUIRED`

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Admin approves without reviewing → allowed (trust admin judgment)
- [ ] Admin rejects → app shows rejection reason + refund status
- [ ] Admin requests info → app shows info-required form (see Phase 4a)
- [ ] Multiple admins reviewing same registration → last action wins (no locking)
- [ ] Admin portal polling (15s) → new registrations appear automatically
- [ ] Admin portal browser notifications → fires when new partner response arrives
- [ ] Dynamic page title shows count: `(2) Wiom Operations Portal`
- [ ] Sound notification plays on new response

### PHASE 4a: Info Required (Back-and-forth)
- [ ] App shows INFO_REQUIRED state with admin's message and requested documents
- [ ] CSP can type a text response and/or upload documents
- [ ] Document types: PAN Card, Aadhaar Card, Address Proof, Bank Statement, Business License, Cancelled Cheque, Other
- [ ] "Submit" calls `POST /v1/partner/respond` with multipart form data
- [ ] Admin portal shows the response with documents in info exchange timeline
- [ ] Admin can request more info (multiple rounds) or approve/reject
- [ ] Each exchange is logged as an `InfoExchange` record with sender (ADMIN/PARTNER)

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Empty response (no text, no files) → validation error
- [ ] Large file upload (>10MB) → check backend limits
- [ ] Unsupported file type → backend should validate mime types
- [ ] Multiple documents in single response → all attached correctly
- [ ] Admin sends info request while CSP is typing → CSP sees updated request on next poll
- [ ] Document download from admin portal → verify files are accessible

### PHASE 5: Training
- [ ] After admin approves → status = `APPROVED` (or `TRAINING`)
- [ ] App shows "Training" state with progress info
- [ ] Admin marks training complete → partner status changes to `ACTIVE`
- [ ] Admin can also mark training failed → `TRAINING_FAILED`

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Training marked complete but partner doesn't see update → 5s polling should catch it
- [ ] Training failed → app shows failure message with support contact info
- [ ] Admin changes mind after marking complete → no undo in current system (manual DB fix needed)

### PHASE 6: Security Deposit Payment (₹20,000)
- [ ] After training complete → partnerStatus = `ACTIVE`, `securityDepositPaid = false`
- [ ] App shows SecurityDepositScreen with ₹20,000 amount
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Payment state is RESET when transitioning from reg fee to security deposit
  - Previous registration fee `SUCCESS` state must NOT leak into this screen
  - PendingViewModel.fetchStatus() handles this reset (lines 111-122)
- [ ] "Pay ₹20,000" button calls `POST /v1/payment/security-deposit/initiate`
- [ ] Backend creates PaymentTransaction (paymentType = `SECURITY_DEPOSIT`)
- [ ] Chrome Custom Tab opens with Juspay link
- [ ] Polling via `GET /v1/payment/security-deposit/status/:transactionId`
- [ ] On success → `securityDepositPaid = true` in DB

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Payment state leaking from registration fee → reset logic in fetchStatus() must work
- [ ] `isSecurityDeposit` flag tracks which payment is active
- [ ] Existing pending security deposit transaction → reuse link (same as reg fee)
- [ ] Backend response format: single wrap only (ResponseInterceptor handles it)
  - **BUG HISTORY:** Controller was double-wrapping → `data.data.paymentLink` was null → fixed
- [ ] All registration fee edge cases apply here too (timeout, retry, network loss, etc.)
- [ ] Security deposit already paid (DB flag true) → should skip this screen entirely
- [ ] Admin portal shows deposit status (PAID/PENDING) in BatchSizeConfig panel

### PHASE 7: "You're All Set" Screen
- [ ] After security deposit paid → partnerStatus = `ACTIVE`, `securityDepositPaid = true`
- [ ] App shows "You're All Set!" screen (NOT auto-redirect)
  - **BUG HISTORY:** Previously auto-called `setPartnerActive(true)` in background polling,
    which triggered NavGraph switch while Chrome tab was in foreground → app crash
- [ ] Two buttons:
  - **"Continue to Dashboard"** → calls `goToDashboard()` → sets `isPartnerActive = true` in DataStore
  - **"Logout"** → clears auth, returns to LoginScreen
- [ ] Polling is stopped at this point (no more status checks needed)

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] User stays on this screen indefinitely → no issue, polling stopped
- [ ] User kills app on this screen → on reopen, PendingScreen loads, fetches status, shows same screen
- [ ] User chooses "Continue to Dashboard" → NavGraph switches to HomeScreen
- [ ] User chooses "Logout" → DataStore cleared, back to LoginScreen
- [ ] App is in background when deposit is confirmed → no crash (no auto-navigation)

### PHASE 8: Dashboard (HomeScreen)
- [ ] After `isPartnerActive = true` → HomeScreen shown
- [ ] Shows CSP dashboard with task feed, stats, etc.
- [ ] Logout available via menu drawer

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] User logs out → all DataStore flags cleared → back to LoginScreen
- [ ] User logs in again with same number → `isProfileComplete = true` (registration exists), `isPartnerActive = true` (partner is ACTIVE) → goes directly to HomeScreen
- [ ] User logs in with new number → fresh flow from Phase 2

### PHASE 9: Admin — NetBox Release
- [ ] Admin portal: after security deposit confirmed, BatchSizeConfig shows "PAID" badge
- [ ] "Release NetBoxes" button becomes enabled (was disabled while deposit pending)
- [ ] Admin sets batch size (default 5) and releases
- [ ] Calls `POST /v1/admin/registrations/:id/batch-size`
- [ ] App picks up `deviceBatchSize` in next status poll

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Release before deposit paid → button disabled, shows "Awaiting security deposit"
- [ ] Batch size = 0 → should be validated (minimum 1)
- [ ] Admin changes batch size after release → allowed, updates DB

## 6. Known Issues & Production Considerations

### Must Fix Before Production
1. **Sandbox mode:** Backend uses sandbox payment (fake Juspay links). Production needs real Juspay API credentials.
2. **OTP backend:** Currently uses QA backend (`services.qa.i2e1.in`). Production needs production OTP service.
3. **HTTPS:** Backend is HTTP only. Production must be HTTPS.
4. **Auth:** JWT token has no expiry handling in app. Add token refresh or re-login flow.
5. **File storage:** Uploaded documents stored locally on server. Production needs S3/cloud storage.
6. **Error messages:** Some raw error messages exposed to user. Sanitize for production.
7. **Rate limiting:** No rate limiting on OTP send or payment initiate endpoints.

### Should Fix
8. **Offline handling:** App has no offline mode. Shows raw errors on network failure.
9. **Form persistence:** Onboarding form data lost if app is killed mid-entry.
10. **Payment retry:** After timeout, user must manually retry. Could auto-retry.
11. **Admin auth:** Admin portal has no authentication. Anyone with the URL can access it.
12. **Concurrent admin actions:** No optimistic locking. Two admins can act on same registration.
13. **Batch size validation:** No minimum/maximum validation on batch size input.

### Nice to Have
14. **Push notifications:** Replace polling with FCM for real-time updates.
15. **Payment receipt:** Show transaction details after successful payment.
16. **Document preview:** Allow viewing uploaded documents in-app.
17. **Biometric auth:** Fingerprint/face unlock for returning users.
18. **Analytics:** Track funnel drop-off at each onboarding step.

## 7. How to Test End-to-End

### Prerequisites
- Android phone connected via USB (or use emulator)
- Backend running at `satyam.wiom.in` (check: `curl http://satyam.wiom.in/v1/health`)
- Admin portal at `http://satyam.wiom.in/csp/admin`

### Clean Test Data
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/satyam-hosting.pem ubuntu@18.61.63.78
mysql -h satyam-hosting.cre2y0mswdtc.ap-south-2.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p'v8d1PQEQ3qGE3YQ' wiom_dev

SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;
DELETE FROM info_documents WHERE infoExchangeId IN (SELECT id FROM info_exchanges WHERE registrationId IN (SELECT id FROM partner_registrations WHERE mobile='PHONE_NUMBER'));
DELETE FROM info_exchanges WHERE registrationId IN (SELECT id FROM partner_registrations WHERE mobile='PHONE_NUMBER');
DELETE FROM payment_transactions WHERE registrationId IN (SELECT id FROM partner_registrations WHERE mobile='PHONE_NUMBER');
-- Delete partner-related tables (tasks, assurance, wallet) if partner exists
DELETE FROM partners WHERE registrationId IN (SELECT id FROM partner_registrations WHERE mobile='PHONE_NUMBER');
DELETE FROM partner_registrations WHERE mobile='PHONE_NUMBER';
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;
```

### Build & Install APK
```bash
cd android/
./gradlew assembleProductionDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/production/debug/app-production-debug.apk
```

### Test Sequence
1. Open app → Login with test phone number → Get OTP → Verify
2. Fill registration form → Submit → See payment screen
3. Pay ₹2,000 (sandbox: click "Pay" on sandbox payment page) → See "Under Review"
4. Open admin portal → Find registration → Approve → Complete Training
5. App auto-updates to SecurityDepositScreen → Pay ₹20,000
6. After payment → See "You're All Set!" screen
7. Tap "Continue to Dashboard" → HomeScreen loads
8. Logout → Login again with same number → Should go directly to HomeScreen (no onboarding)

---

## 8. Sandbox Payment Flow
The backend is in sandbox mode. When payment is initiated:
1. A fake transaction ID is generated (`sandbox_...` or `sandbox_sd_...`)
2. A payment link is generated pointing to `/v1/payment/sandbox/pay/:id`
3. Opening this link in browser shows a simple "Pay" button
4. Clicking it marks the transaction as SUCCESS in DB
5. App polling detects the success and updates UI

No real money is involved. Production will use actual Juspay API.
